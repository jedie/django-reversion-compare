django-reversion-compare
========================

**django-reversion-compare** is an extension to `django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion/>`_ that provides a history compare view to compare two versions of a model which is under reversion.

Comparing model versions is not a easy task. Maybe there are different view how this should looks like.
This project will gives you a generic way to see whats has been changed.

Many parts are customizable by overwrite methods or subclassing, see above.

------------
Installation
------------

Just use:

::

    pip install django-reversion-compare

Setup
=====

Add **reversion_compare** to **INSTALLED_APPS** in your settings.py, e.g.:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django...',
        ...
        'reversion', # https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion
        'reversion_compare', # https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare
        ...
    )
    
    # Add reversion models to admin interface:
    ADD_REVERSION_ADMIN=True
    # optional settings:
    REVERSION_COMPARE_FOREIGN_OBJECTS_AS_ID=False
    REVERSION_COMPARE_IGNORE_NOT_REGISTERED=False

Usage
=====

Inherit from **CompareVersionAdmin** instead of **VersionAdmin** to get the comparison feature.

admin.py e.g.:

::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from reversion_compare.admin import CompareVersionAdmin
    
    from my_app.models import ExampleModel
    
    @admin.register(ExampleModel)
    class ExampleModelAdmin(CompareVersionAdmin):
        pass

If you're using an existing third party app, then you can add patch django-reversion-compare into
its admin class by using the **reversion_compare.helpers.patch_admin()** method. For example, to add
version control to the built-in User model:

::

    from reversion_compare.helpers import patch_admin
    
    patch_admin(User)

e.g.: Add django-cms Page model:

::

    from cms.models.pagemodel import Page
    from reversion_compare.helpers import patch_admin
    
    
    # Patch django-cms Page Model to add reversion-compare functionality:
    patch_admin(Page)

Customize
=========

It's possible to change the look for every field or for a entire field type.
You must only define a methods to your admin class with this name scheme:

*  ``"compare_%s" % field_name`` 

*  ``"compare_%s" % field.get_internal_type()`` 

If there is no method with this name scheme, the ``fallback_compare()`` method will be used.

An example for specifying a compare method for a model field by name:

::

    class YourAdmin(CompareVersionAdmin):
        def compare_foo_bar(self, obj_compare):
            """ compare the foo_bar model field """
            return "%r <-> %r" % (obj_compare.value1, obj_compare.value2)

and example using **patch_admin** with custom version admin class:

::

    patch_admin(User, AdminClass=YourAdmin)

----------------
Class Based View
----------------

Beyond the Admin views, you can also create a Class Based View for displaying and comparing version
differences. This is a single class-based-view that either displays the list of versions to select
for an object or displays both the versions **and** their differences (if the versions to be compared
have been selected). This class can be used just like a normal DetailView:

More information about this can be found in DocString of:

* `HistoryCompareDetailView <https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare/blob/master/reversion_compare/views.py>`_

The ``make run-test-server`` test project contains a Demo, use the links under:

How to select the versions to compare:

----

from **v0.1.0**: DateTimeField compare (last update), TextField compare (content) with small changes and a ForeignKey compare (child model instance was added):

|django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-02.png|

.. |django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-02.png| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/django-reversion-compare/20120508_django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-02.png

----

from **v0.1.0**: Same as above, but the are more lines changed in TextField and the ForeignKey relation was removed:

----

Example screenshot from **v0.3.0**: a many-to-many field compare (friends, hobbies):

|django-reversion-compare_v0_3_0-01.png|

* In the first line, the m2m object has been changed.

* line 2: A m2m object was deleted

* line 3: A m2m object was removed from this entry (but not deleted)

* line 4: This m2m object has not changed

----------------------------
create developer environment
----------------------------

e.g.:

::

    # Clone project (Use your fork SSH url!):
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare.git
    ~$ cd django-reversion-compare
    ~/django-reversion-compare$ make install
    ~/django-reversion-compare$ make
    help                 List all commands
    install-poetry       install or update poetry via pip
    install              install via poetry
    update               Update the dependencies as according to the pyproject.toml file
    lint                 Run code formatters and linter
    fix-code-style       Fix code formatting
    pyupgrade            Run pyupgrade
    tox-listenvs         List all tox test environments
    tox                  Run pytest via tox with all environments
    pytest               Run pytest
    update-rst-readme    update README.rst from README.creole
    publish              Release new version to PyPi
    run-test-server      Start Django dev server with the test project
    makemessages         Make and compile locales message files

Helpful for writing and debugging unittests is to run a local test server with the same data.
e.g.:

::

    ~/django-reversion-compare$ make run-test-server

**migration** will be run.

Call manage commands from test project, e.g.:

::

    ~/django-reversion-compare$ poetry shell
    django-reversion-compare-foobar-py3.6) ~/django-reversion-compare$ ./reversion_compare_tests/manage.py --help
    ...
