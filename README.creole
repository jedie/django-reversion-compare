= django-reversion-compare =

**django-reversion-compare** is an extension to [[https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion/|django-reversion]] that provides a history compare view to compare two versions of a model which is under reversion.

Comparing model versions is not a easy task. Maybe there are different view how this should looks like.
This project will gives you a generic way to see whats has been changed.

Many parts are customizable by overwrite methods or subclassing, see above.

== Installation ==

Just use:
{{{
pip install django-reversion-compare
}}}


=== Setup ===

Add **reversion_compare** to **INSTALLED_APPS** in your settings.py, e.g.:
{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django...',
    ...
    'reversion', # https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion
    'reversion_compare', # https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare
    ...
)

# Add reversion models to admin interface:
ADD_REVERSION_ADMIN=True
# optional settings:
REVERSION_COMPARE_FOREIGN_OBJECTS_AS_ID=False
REVERSION_COMPARE_IGNORE_NOT_REGISTERED=False
}}}

=== Usage ===

Inherit from **CompareVersionAdmin** instead of **VersionAdmin** to get the comparison feature.

admin.py e.g.:
{{{
from django.contrib import admin
from reversion_compare.admin import CompareVersionAdmin

from my_app.models import ExampleModel

@admin.register(ExampleModel)
class ExampleModelAdmin(CompareVersionAdmin):
    pass
}}}

If you're using an existing third party app, then you can add patch django-reversion-compare into
its admin class by using the **reversion_compare.helpers.patch_admin()** method. For example, to add
version control to the built-in User model:

{{{
from reversion_compare.helpers import patch_admin

patch_admin(User)
}}}

e.g.: Add django-cms Page model:
{{{
from cms.models.pagemodel import Page
from reversion_compare.helpers import patch_admin


# Patch django-cms Page Model to add reversion-compare functionality:
patch_admin(Page)
}}}


=== Customize ===

It's possible to change the look for every field or for a entire field type.
You must only define a methods to your admin class with this name scheme:

* {{{ "compare_%s" % field_name }}}
* {{{ "compare_%s" % field.get_internal_type() }}}

If there is no method with this name scheme, the {{{ fallback_compare() }}} method will be used.

An example for specifying a compare method for a model field by name:

{{{
class YourAdmin(CompareVersionAdmin):
    def compare_foo_bar(self, obj_compare):
        """ compare the foo_bar model field """
        return "%r <-> %r" % (obj_compare.value1, obj_compare.value2)
}}}

and example using **patch_admin** with custom version admin class:
{{{
patch_admin(User, AdminClass=YourAdmin)
}}}


== Class Based View ==

Beyond the Admin views, you can also create a Class Based View for displaying and comparing version
differences. This is a single class-based-view that either displays the list of versions to select
for an object or displays both the versions **and** their differences (if the versions to be compared
have been selected). This class can be used just like a normal DetailView:

More information about this can be found in DocString of:

* [[https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare/blob/master/reversion_compare/views.py|HistoryCompareDetailView]]

The {{{make run-test-server}}} test project contains a Demo, use the links under:

{{{
HistoryCompareDetailView Examples:
}}}


== Screenshots ==

Here some screenshots of django-reversion-compare:

----

How to select the versions to compare:

{{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/django-reversion-compare/20120508_django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-01.png|django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-01.png}}

----

from **v0.1.0**: DateTimeField compare (last update), TextField compare (content) with small changes and a ForeignKey compare (child model instance was added):

{{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/django-reversion-compare/20120508_django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-02.png|django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-02.png}}

----

from **v0.1.0**: Same as above, but the are more lines changed in TextField and the ForeignKey relation was removed:

{{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/django-reversion-compare/20120508_django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-03.png|django-reversion-compare_v0_1_0-03.png}}

----

Example screenshot from **v0.3.0**: a many-to-many field compare (friends, hobbies):

{{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/django-reversion-compare/20120516_django-reversion-compare_v0_3_0-01.png|django-reversion-compare_v0_3_0-01.png}}

* In the first line, the m2m object has been changed.
* line 2: A m2m object was deleted
* line 3: A m2m object was removed from this entry (but not deleted)
* line 4: This m2m object has not changed


== create developer environment

e.g.:
{{{
# Clone project (Use your fork SSH url!):
~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare.git
~$ cd django-reversion-compare
~/django-reversion-compare$ make install
~/django-reversion-compare$ make
help                 List all commands
install-poetry       install or update poetry via pip
install              install via poetry
update               Update the dependencies as according to the pyproject.toml file
lint                 Run code formatters and linter
fix-code-style       Fix code formatting
pyupgrade            Run pyupgrade
tox-listenvs         List all tox test environments
tox                  Run pytest via tox with all environments
pytest               Run pytest
update-rst-readme    update README.rst from README.creole
publish              Release new version to PyPi
run-test-server      Start Django dev server with the test project
makemessages         Make and compile locales message files
}}}


Helpful for writing and debugging unittests is to run a local test server with the same data.
e.g.:
{{{
~/django-reversion-compare$ make run-test-server
}}}
**migration** will be run.

Call manage commands from test project, e.g.:
{{{
~/django-reversion-compare$ poetry shell
django-reversion-compare-foobar-py3.6) ~/django-reversion-compare$ ./reversion_compare_tests/manage.py --help
...
}}}
